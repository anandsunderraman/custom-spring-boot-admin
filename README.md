Testing visualizing a custom endpoint

I am trying to visualize a custom actuator in spring boot admin server.

The main purpose here is to try to visualize a custom endpoint in spring boot admin server.

I am creating this repo to show what I have tried for the question posted in stackoverflow at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53418992/spring-boot-admin-add-custom-tab

The documentation says

```
The Javascript-Bundle and Css-Stlysheet must be placed on the classpath at /META-INF/spring-boot-admin-server-ui/extensions/{name}/ so the server can pick them up.
```

Question is where would I get the js and css bundle from ?

I have also tried using the js and css bundle generated by https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin/tree/master/spring-boot-admin-samples/spring-boot-admin-sample-custom-ui/

but still of no avail.

Any help in learning how to integrate the two will be nice.
